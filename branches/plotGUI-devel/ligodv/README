This is the main directory, the subdirectories are organized 
into logical groups of functions and classes.
Or at least they will be there are stil quite a few unclassified.

The operation does not depend on the exact structure of the directories 
but they all must be underneath the one containing the ligodv_start function.

The program is usually started by cd <this directory> && matlab -r ligodv_start

In the directory above this there is a script called ligodv.  You may want to
edit that script to 
a) Change the prefix variable to point to this directory.
b) Uncomment the MATLAB export and have it point to the latest version of Matlab installed
c) Copy it to somewhere in your path

Then you can start ligoDV with the command ligodv
