% WCONDITION High pass filter and whiten time series data
%
% WCONDITION high pass filters and whitens time series data prior to analysis
% by the Q transform.  The data is first zero-phase high pass filtered at the
% minimum analysis frequency specified in the tiling structure.  The resulting
% high pass filtered data is then whitened by zero-phase linear prediction at
% a frequency resolution equal to the minimum analysis bandwidth requested in
% the tiling structure.  Note that the resulting whitened data is returned as
% a frequency series, not a time series.  In addition, the returned frequency
% series extends from zero frequency to the Nyquist frequency.  As a result,
% they are of length N / 2 + 1, where N is the length of the individual input
% time series.  The returned frequency-domain whitened data is normalized to
% unity amplitude spectral density.
%
% To enable recovery of calibrated amplitude and phase information, WCONDITION
% also returns the effective frequency domain coefficients of the combined high
% pass and whitening filters for each channel.
%
% WCONDITION also permits double whitening of the data to support true matched
% filtering.  Regardless of whether double whitening is requested or not, the
% returned frequency-domain filter coefficients always correspond to the single
% whitened case.
%
% usage:
%
%   [conditionedData, coefficients] = wcondition(rawData, tiling, doubleWhiten);
%
%   rawData               cell array of input time series
%   tiling                discrete Q transform tiling structure from WTILE
%
%   conditionedData       cell array of conditioned output frequency series
%   coefficients          cell array of frequency domain filter coefficients
%   doubleWhiten          boolean flag to enable double whitening
%
% There is also an alternative output syntax, which provides access to the
% intermediate raw and high pass filtered data for use by WSCAN.
